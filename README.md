# LEDControl

## Summary
It can be used to control LED using Arduino (onboard or external), over USB (serial port, in fact).
It automatically lists all available COM ports, you can pick and therefore send pre-programmed commands to the Arduino.

If you are using a clone, make sure you have required drivers, as well as correct mode set on the Arduino IDE when you try and upload it.

So far, it supports these patterns:
* Constant ON
* Constant blinking
* 3x rapid blinking
